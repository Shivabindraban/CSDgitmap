Panning Modulation

AM and FM are both widely known and often used in audio synthesis. They both have their unique way of giving an electronic feel to the synth, the speed of the modulation creates new sounds.
I wanted to use such a technique to any incoming sound to create something new, something fresh. So I played with the speed of auto-panning an incoming signal. At a low frequency, the new signal will sound as if the audio is moving from your right to left ear at a given speed.
At high frequency rates, this back and forth moving is not as observable. No, a new modified sound will be percepted. Hence, I wanted to share this new technique with you all. This is secretly AM with a twist. The panning speed is given a range, so the effect keeps it worth. Furthermore, you are able to change the amount of the effect with another slider to your liking.
Happy Sound Designing!

NOTE: THE FILES WERE TOO BIG TO UPLOAD. Hence I only uploaded the code I programmed myself, not the added modules.
They can be however be found in the link down below.
